            <h2>Why Cape Town?</h2>
            <h3>Cape Town, the city of natural wonder and diversity</h3>
            <p>
              Cape Town is where wild beauty meets soulful rhythm. Nestled
              between the iconic Table Mountain and the sparkling Atlantic
              Ocean, this coastal gem invites you into a world of breathtaking
              contrasts—lush vineyards rolling into sun-drenched beaches,
              colorful Bo-Kaap homes whispering centuries of history, and
              vibrant street markets buzzing with flavor, fashion, and heart.
              Whether you're hiking a mountain at sunrise, savoring fresh
              seafood with ocean views, or dancing to Afrobeat under the stars,
              Cape Town is not just a destination—it’s an experience for every
              sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              This city pulses with creativity and resilience, rooted in a rich
              cultural tapestry woven by diverse communities. From the townships
              to the waterfront, from Robben Island to the art galleries of
              Woodstock, Cape Town’s stories echo through every street and
              smile. Here, nature and humanity coexist in powerful harmony,
              offering both grounding and inspiration. Come for the views, stay
              for the vibe—Cape Town doesn’t just leave a mark on your passport,
              it leaves a mark on your soul.

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
              Hi! My name is Ricquel and Cape Town, South Africa is my favorite
              city in the world that I've visited. I love the city because it is
              a beautiful landscape with beautiful people and so much to offer.
              I created this page as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive
              to develop my coding skills.
